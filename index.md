## What is web-ir?

web-ir is a technology that converts your game into a format that runs directly in the web browser.

Once converted, players can enjoy your game right inside a web browser without the need of downloading or installation,
which makes your game much easier for players to try and share. It also helps your game get a lot more exposure than ever.

## What game engines are supported?

Theoretically any kind of game engines can be supported. But currently we're focusing on the most popular ones like _Unity_, _Unreal Engine 4_ and _Cocos2D-x_.

## For game engines already ported to web browser, are you reinventing the wheel?

Well, game engines such as _Unity_ and _Unreal Engine 4_ do have been ported to web browser thanks to _Emscripten_. However, Emscripten has many issues
like slow startup times, crash on mobiles, no multi-threading, no TCP/UDP networking and so on.

web-ir can do a lot better.
