## So, what is Web-IR?

Web-IR is a technology that converts your game into a format that runs directly in a browser.

Once converted, players can enjoy your game right inside a browser without the need of downloading or installation.
It would be much easier for players to try and share your game as it's just a link. Your game will also get a lot more exposure than ever.

## What game engines are supported?

Theoretically Web-IR supports any kinds of game engines. But currently we're focusing on the most popular ones like _Unity_, _Unreal Engine 4_ and _Cocos2D-x_.

## Game engines are already ported to browser. Are you re-inventing wheels?

Well, game engines like Unity and Unreal Engine 4 do have ported to browser thanks to Emscripten, but the result is way **NOT** good enough.

Emscripten has its limitations, like slow download/startup times, crash on large assets,
no support of multi-threading or TCP/UDP networking and so on. It does work with some games of small footprints, but a lot of times it just fails to even start running.

Web-IR can do a lot better than that.
